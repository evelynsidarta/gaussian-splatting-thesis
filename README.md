How to Use 3DGS Training Template in Google Colab:
1. upload training_template.ipynb to somewhere in your Google Drive
2. right click and select Open With -> Google Colaboratory (make sure to get Google Colaboratory beforehand)

Main Sources:
1. Original Implementation of Gaussian Splatting - https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting
   (adjusted to windows)
2. Colab Template for Gaussian Splatting

Disclaimer: I only mostly compiled and adapted the code from (2) to run on the Nov 2024 version of Gaussian Splatting from the original repo and streamlined the whole process for better ease of use (for my personal use).
