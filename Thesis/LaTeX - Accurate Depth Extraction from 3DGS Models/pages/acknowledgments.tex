Additionally, I would like to thank all the parties that have indirectly been involved in the creation of this work--thank you to Louis Bidou for creating the immaculate \textit{Chocolate Bunny}, and also to creators of the depth extraction models involved in this study. Thank you for laying down the key foundations to my work and thank you for your contributions in the 3D Graphics community.
