While high visual quality can be achieved using sophisticated ray tracing techniques, interactive applications typically use either coarsely tessellated polygonal approximations or pre-rendered depth sprites, thereby trading off visual quality and perspective correctness for higher rendering performance. In contrast, we propose an efficient rendering technique for quadric primitives based on GPU-accelerated splatting. While providing similar performance as point-sprites, our methods provides perspective correctness and superior visual quality using per-pixel ray-casting.},

Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

This paper presents the case for four-channel pictures, demonstrating that a matte component can be computed similarly to the color channels.

        abstract        ={We present a new, real-time method for rendering diffuse and glossy objects in low-frequency lighting environments that captures soft shadows, interreflections, and caustics. As a preprocess, a novel global transport simulator creates functions over the object's surface representing transfer of arbitrary, low-frequency incident lighting into transferred radiance which includes global effects like shadows and interreflections from the object onto itself. At run-time, these transfer functions are applied to actual incident lighting. Dynamic, local lighting is handled by sampling it close to the object every frame; the object can also be rigidly rotated with respect to the lighting and vice versa. Lighting and transfer functions are represented using low-order spherical harmonics. This avoids aliasing and evaluates efficiently on graphics hardware by reducing the shading integral to a dot product of 9 to 25 element vectors for diffuse receivers. Glossy objects are handled using matrices rather than vectors. We further introduce functions for radiance transfer from a dynamic lighting environment through a preprocessed object to neighboring points in space. These allow soft shadows and caustics from rigidly moving objects to be cast onto arbitrary, dynamic receivers. We demonstrate real-time global lighting effects with this approach.

        abstract        ={We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship between incoming radiance and irradiance. Specifically, we address the question of whether it is possible to compute the incident radiance from knowledge of the irradiance at all surface orientations. This is a fundamental question in computer vision and inverse radiative transfer. We show that the irradiance can be viewed as a simple convolution of the incident illumination, i.e., radiance and a clamped cosine transfer function. Estimating the radiance can then be seen as a deconvolution operation. We derive a simple closed-form formula for the irradiance in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients of the incident illumination and demonstrate that the odd-order modes of the lighting with order greater than 1 are completely annihilated. Therefore these components cannot be estimated from the irradiance, contradicting a theorem that is due to Preisendorfer. A practical realization of the radiance-from-irradiance problem is the estimation of the lighting from images of a homogeneous convex curved Lambertian surface of known geometry under distant illumination, since a Lambertian object reflects light equally in all directions proportional to the irradiance. We briefly discuss practical and physical considerations and describe a simple experimental test to verify our theoretical results.},

        abstract        ={This paper is a survey of the theory and methods of photogrammetric bundle adjustment, aimed at potential implementors in the computer vision community. Bundle adjustment is the problem of refining a visual reconstruction to produce jointly optimal structure and viewing parameter estimates. Topics covered include: the choice of cost function and robustness; numerical optimization including sparse Newton methods, linearly convergent approximations, updating and recursive methods; gauge (datum) invariance; and quality control. The theory is developed for general robust cost functions rather than restricting attention to traditional nonlinear least squares.},

        abstract        ={3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently revolutionized the field of neural rendering with its high fidelity and efficiency. However, 3DGS heavily depends on the initialized point cloud produced by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques. When tackling large-scale scenes that unavoidably contain texture-less surfaces, SfM techniques fail to produce enough points in these surfaces and cannot provide good initialization for 3DGS. As a result, 3DGS suffers from difficult optimization and low-quality renderings. In this paper, inspired by classic multi-view stereo (MVS) techniques, we propose GaussianPro, a novel method that applies a progressive propagation strategy to guide the densification of the 3D Gaussians. Compared to the simple split and clone strategies used in 3DGS, our method leverages the priors of the existing reconstructed geometries of the scene and utilizes patch matching to produce new Gaussians with accurate positions and orientations. Experiments on both large-scale and small-scale scenes validate the effectiveness of our method. Our method significantly surpasses 3DGS on the Waymo dataset, exhibiting an improvement of 1.15dB in terms of PSNR. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/kcheng1021/GaussianPro.}

        abstract        ="Recently RGB-D sensors have become very popular in the area of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). The major advantage of these sensors is that they provide a rich source of 3D information at relatively low cost. Unfortunately, these sensors in their current forms only have a range accuracy of up to 4 metres. Many techniques which perform SLAM using RGB-D cameras rely heavily on the depth and are restrained to office type and geometrically structured environments. In this paper, a switching based algorithm is proposed to heuristically choose between RGB-BA and RGBD-BA based local maps building. Furthermore, a low cost and consistent optimisation approach is used to join these maps. Thus the potential of both RGB and depth image information are exploited to perform robust SLAM in more general indoor cases. Validation of the proposed algorithm is performed by mapping a large scale indoor scene where traditional RGB-D mapping techniques are not possible.",
